The data dependency handling of Data Parallell Haskell coupled with an approach to multigraded Gr√∂bner basis computation that tracks dependencies in successively computed multidegrees may well be a fruitful approach to several outstanding problems in computational algebra.

This project aims to take a crack at those using these ideas.
